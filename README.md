# Stock Simulator

#### Video Demo: to be added

## Description:
* Web application that allows simulated trading of stocks from the US stock market. 
* Investors can practice buying and selling of stocks without risking real money.


#### Tech and files :
This project was created using the python framework Flask.
The HTML template files were implemented using Jinja.
The real time stock price data was fetched from [IEX CLoud](https://iexcloud.io/) as it lets you download stock quotes via their API.

## Resources : 
This project is inspired by a problem set which I encountered during the course[CS50x 2021](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/).
Along with that, the official documentation of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/) and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/) were really useful.
